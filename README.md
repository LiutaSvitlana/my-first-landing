This is my first project where I've created a complete landing page layout using HTML and CSS. The design uses units of measurement in px. In addition to building this landing page, I have also delved into the fundamentals of Git and GitHub. 
## Here are the key areas I've studied: 
- **Repository**. I created a repository for this landing page.
- **Branching**.
- **Commands**. Basic Git commands learned include *git init*, *git add*, *git commit*, *git push*, *git pull*, and *git merge*.

Future Enhancements: Responsive Design, JavaScript Integration, Additional Pages.
